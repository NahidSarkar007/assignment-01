            <p class="speech"> I strongly believe that we can create a poverty-free world, if we want to. We can create a world where there won.t be a single human being who could be described as a poor person. In that world, the only place you would find poverty is in the museum. When school children will take a tour of the poverty museums, they would be horrified to see the misery and indignity that human beings once experienced. They would blame their forefathers for tolerating this inhuman condition which existed for so many people for so long</p>
